                <h2>About Me</h2>
                
                <p id="me">I grew up in Roy, UT and joined the Marine Corps when I turned 18. My Military Occupation Specialtiy (MOS) was 1371 or a combat engineer. Once I discharged from the military, I thought I wanted to continue my career in engineering, but after working for Northrup Grumman, I discovered it was not for me. So after some soul-searching, I earned a bachelor's degree in microbiology from Weber State University. I have enjoyed my career thus far in the world of microbiology, it is not as fulfilling as I had hoped, but now I'm pursuing a new career in software development that I am enjoying everyday.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Working with a team of classmates, we were able to create a simple application with a dropdown menu to select parks and display the current weather and a synopsis of activities there. This project was mainly for us to get a handle on the basics, as it is made using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective was to call an API: we have one API that populates the dropdown menu with a list of parks in Utah, and another API that takes the zipcode from the selected park and provides weather information.</p>
