                <h2>About Me</h2>
                
                <p id="me">Born and raised in Northern Utah, enlisted in the United States Marine Corps at 18 and active duty 2012 - 2016 as a Combat Engineer.  Upon discharging from the armed forces, I continued to pursue my career in engineering.  After a few years of employment with Northrup Grumman(Orbital ATK), I discovered it was not for me. So after some soul-searching, I earned a bachelor's degree in microbiology from Weber State University. I have enjoyed my career thus far in the world of microbiology, it is not as fulfilling as I had hoped, but now I'm pursuing a new career in software development that I am enjoying everyday.</p>

                    <h3><a href=" https://dillonpatino.github.io/Project-1/" target="_blank">Project 1: National Parks and Weather App</a></h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Working with a team of classmates, we were able to create a simple application with a dropdown menu to select parks and display the current weather and a synopsis of activities there. This project was mainly for us to get a handle on the basics, as it is made using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective was to call an API: we have one API that populates the dropdown menu with a list of parks in Utah, and another API that takes the zipcode from the selected park and provides weather information.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Again, working as a team, we went to work with the idea of creating a 'tinder-like' platfrom where you could swipe on cards of restaurants and match with your significant other's choice of restaurant, leaving the arguing comepletely out of dinner. For them meantime, it serves as a simple but fun restaurant locator using back-end and front-end software.</p>
